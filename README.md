V2------Blind Roller Remote Control Using Step Motor //In Progress 

-I used NEMA17 Step motor to have more certain control over the angles.
-I used TMC2209 to drive the step motor sliently and smoothly.
-I used NODEMCU ESP8266 - In the future i will use my own self-produced item.
-I will update box to cover step motor and mount it to the blind roller system ---Designs are made on Fusion 360 and printed by 3D printer by me.
-I used PLA for cover and used ABS for gear system.
-I will be sharing STL files and NODEMCU codes on this page.
